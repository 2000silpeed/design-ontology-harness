Before making changes:

1. Read `design-system/system_spec.md`.
2. Read `design-system/token_schema.json`.
3. Read `design-system/component_inventory.json`.

Implementation rules:

- Treat the design-system artifacts as the source of truth.
- Keep implementation aligned with the product's brand keywords and anti-keywords.
- Implement high-priority component families before medium-priority families.
- Reuse or extend primitives before adding net-new components.
- Preserve existing features, navigation entry points, and data flows unless removal is explicitly requested.
- Keep supported themes, breakpoints, and critical interaction states working while refactoring.
- Prefer semantic tokens over one-off hardcoded colors so theme support survives future changes.
- Default to the smallest viable surface refactor; do not rewrite the whole shell unless the task explicitly calls for it.
- If `token_schema.json` includes a curated color reference or palette roles, align color decisions to that input before inventing a new palette.
- Update nearby documentation or tests when implementation meaningfully changes.
- NEVER change layout properties (display, flex-direction, grid-template, position, width, height).
- NEVER change font-size or line-height to "fit the token scale." Existing sizes are tuned to the layout. Only replace when the token resolves to the exact same px. If no match, keep original + TODO.
- NEVER round spacing values to the nearest token — if no exact match, leave as-is with a TODO.
- **NEVER use emojis as UI icons, state indicators, button decorations, or navigation markers** (no 🎨 ✅ 🔥 ⚡ 🚀 ❌ ⭐ 📊 etc.). Always implement proper SVG icon components or import from Lucide / Heroicons / Phosphor / Tabler. Emojis are only allowed inside user-generated content (blog text, user input) — never as part of the design system itself.
- **NEVER leave half-finished components** like "TODO component", "placeholder card", "temp button". Read `design-system/components/component_specs.md` and implement the full anatomy, states, and token bindings defined there.
- **NEVER use bare library components (e.g., default `<Button>` from a UI lib) without binding design tokens.** Every component must have its colors, spacing, radius, and typography wired to the token system. If you import from a library, wrap it and override styles with CSS variables from the token schema.

When finishing:

- State which artifact files guided the implementation.
- Mention any gaps between the requested UI and the current system artifacts.
- Mention any feature, theme, or layout risks that still need manual verification.
